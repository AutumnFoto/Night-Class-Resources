# Creating a new local project
To start our react project we will use an npx command.
* npm - allows you to install packages
* npx - allows developers to build scripts that run.  Sometimes these scripts include installing packages.

In our case the facebook developers have built out an npx script that creates a quick build of react by -  installing all the required packages (via npm), setting up webpack, and building out the structure of a basic application.

Basic syntax for starting a project is this:
```bash
npx create-react-app APPLICATIONNAME
```

Lets make a new project:
```bash
npx create-react-app react-setup
```

If the above command didn't work for you, you need to update npm.  Find an instructor to help you with that. Usually a `npm install -g npm` will to the update for you
